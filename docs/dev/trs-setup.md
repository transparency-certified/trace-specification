# TRACE Server Setup Guide

## Pre-requisites

This guide will help you set up a TRACE server and infrastructure. This involves:

- Having a way to sign the TROs (Trace Record Objects) that are generated by the TRACE server. TRACE allows for GPG and X.509. See [Signing](signing) for more information.
- Having a way to display the TRS (Trace Record Server) capabilities and the TROs that are generated by the TRACE server, via a **web server**.
- Reference tools are implemented using Python, but could be implemented in other languages.

Throughout, we will provide a running example for a functional sample server.

:::{admonition} Example
:class: note

The example assumes that you have a system running **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**.  We assume that you can execute commands as the `root` user via `sudo`. We recommend that you create a dedicated user for running the TRACE Server. In our example we will use the username `ubuntu`.

You could run this in a virgin Ubuntu 24.04 container:

```bash
mkdir trace-test
cd trace-test
docker run -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd):/project -w /project -u ubuntu -it --rm ubuntu:24.04
```

Before you begin, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- [GPG](https://gnupg.org/)
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)

You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gnupg python3
```

:::


## Initial setup

TRACE requires a digital signature mechanism. This is used to 

- sign the system descriptions (TRS)
- sign the TROs (Trace Record Objects)

These should be permanently associated with a system, and can be used for multiple TRS. The private keys, as well as any passphrases used, should be kept secure.


:::{admonition} Example: Generating a GPG key pair
:class: note, dropdown



To generate a GPG key pair, run the following command:

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

```bash
gpg (GnuPG) 2.4.4; Copyright (C) 2024 g10 Code GmbH
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (9) ECC (sign and encrypt) *default*

Please select which elliptic curve you want:
   (1) Curve 25519 *default*
   (4) NIST P-384
   (6) Brainpool P-256
Your selection? 1
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 2y
Key expires at Fri Jan 15 15:05:04 2027 UTC
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Example Trace System
Email address: valid.email@my.organization.com
Comment: 
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Example Trace System <valid.email@my.organization.com>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
```

At this stage you will be asked to enter a passphrase. This passphrase will be used to unlock your private key when you need to use it. Make sure you remember this passphrase, as you will need it later on. For this example we are going to use `s3cr3tkey`.

```bash

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

```

Please note that the key that we just generated has a fingerprint of `9A5209A464B9E0CFCCD108C96FB96730E419869C`. You will need this fingerprint for signing TROs. You can ensure that proper fingerprint and secret is used during the signing process by adding the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
export GPG_FINGERPRINT="9A5209A464B9E0CFCCD108C96FB96730E419869C"
export GPG_PASSPHRASE="s3cr3tkey"
```

## Setting up the TRACE Server Environment

The TRACE "server" environment is where the workflow is executed. This will depend greatly on the existing infrastructure, and is meant to be general. Your environment will need the tools to collect and sign the information for TROs, but can otherwise be quite variable. The section about [TRS Description](trs-description) will capture this environment in a formal manner. 



:::{admonition} Example: setting up
:class: note

Our example relies on R and Python for data processing, Docker for workflow execution, and `git` for accessing user contributed code that we are going to run. 

```bash
sudo apt install -y git python3-pip python3-venv docker.io docker-buildx
```

:::

## Installing TRO-UTILS

We have prepared a reference implemenation in Python to simplify the generation of TROS. We suggest to use these in your TRACE server if possible. The utilities are available at [tro-utils](https://pypi.org/project/tro-utils/).

:::{admonition} Example: Installing `tro-utils`
:class: note

**Installing dependencies for `tro-utils`**

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv libmagic-dev
```

**Setting some recurring names**

```bash
PROJBASE=/project           # Adjust as necessary
TROFILE=$PROJBASE/sample_tro-$(date +%F-%H-%M-%S).jsonld
TRS_LOCATION=~/trs.jsonld        # We keep this outside of the Project directory
WEBBASE=$PROJBASE/trs-template   # We will use this for the sample web server

export PROJBASE TROFILE TRS_LOCATION

```

**Installing `tro-utils`**

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/trs-env   # Create a virtual environment for the TRACE Server
source ~/trs-env/bin/activate    # Activate the virtual environment
```

Your prompt will switch to `(trs-env)`. For convenience, we omit it here.

```bash
pip install tro-utils       # Install tro-utils
```

The output should be somewhat like this:

```bash
Successfully installed Click-8.1.8 MarkupSafe-3.0.2 certifi-2025.1.31 cffi-1.17.1 charset-normalizer-3.4.1 cryptography-44.0.2 graphviz-0.20.3 idna-3.10 jinja2-3.1.6 pyasn1-0.6.1 pyasn1-modules-0.4.2 pycparser-2.22 python-dateutil-2.9.0.post0 python-gnupg-0.5.4 python-magic-0.4.27 requests-2.32.3 rfc3161ng-2.1.3 six-1.17.0 tro-utils-0.1.0 urllib3-2.4.0

```



:::

(trs-description)=
### Define the TRACE Server capabilities

TROs contain by default basic information about the TRS that was used to generate them. We therefore need to specify the [TRACE System
Certificate](element-trace-certificate), that specifies how transparency is
supported by the system and a signing key associated with the certificate. The current implementation reliese on a JSON-LD representation of the capabilities of the system. By convention, this is stored in a file `trs.jsonld` or similar. There can be multiple such specifications in use at the same time. Those in use should be separately published (see [web server](web-server)), and preserved.

The TRACE System Certificate is expressed in structured language that describe assertions about supported transparency levels and features (see
  [transparency questions](questions)).


:::{margin} **`trs.jsonld** needs key specification?
:class: note
To be consistent, we need the key specification as part of the sample JSON-LD file.
:::

:::{admonition} Example: Creating a TRS description
:class: note

Create `~/trs.jsonld` with the following content:

```json
  {
    "rdfs:comment": "TRS that can monitor netowork accesses or provide Internet isolation",
    "trov:hasCapability": [
      {
        "@id": "trs/capability/1",
        "@type": "trov:CanRecordInternetAccess"
      },
      {
        "@id": "trs/capability/2",
        "@type": "trov:CanProvideInternetIsolation"
      }
    ],
    "trov:owner": "My Organization",
    "trov:description": "Example TRACE Server",
    "trov:contact": "valid_email@my.organization.com",
    "trov:url": "http://127.0.0.1/",
    "trov:name": "myorg-trs",
    "trov:gpgFingerprint": "9A5209A464B9E0CFCCD108C96FB96730E419869C"
  }
```

(adjust the `trov:gpgFingerprint` to your own key fingerprint)

:::



## Preparing pipeline


:::{admonition} Example: Executing example TRO generation
:class: note

We use for the example a somewhat typical simple research workflow. The sample workflow contains all data, and relies on a containerized R processing pipeline. 

1. Download the repository containing the example user code for creating TRO:

```bash
cd $PROJBASE
git clone https://github.com/transparency-certified/sample-trace-workflow
```
:::

## Preparing for a TRACE-compliant workflow recording

The TRO toolkit should be able to access the user-provided code. Note that by most definitions of trusted workflows, this part of the recording happens in a hands-off manner, without user interaction. The first step necessarily instantiates a project-specific TRO with the unmodified user code, before it is run.

:::{admonition} Example: Initiate TRO before executing user code:
:class: note


```bash
source ~/trs-env/bin/activate
tro-utils --declaration $TROFILE \
    --profile $TRS_LOCATION \
    arrangement add sample-trace-workflow \
    -m "Before executing workflow" -i .git
```

with output

```
Loading profile from /home/ubuntu/trs.jsonld
```
:::

## Executing defined workflow.


At this point, the intial TRO has been created. The various tasks that a typical workflow requires are now executed. At the core, this means executing the user-provided research code, however, it might also entail discrete additional (manual) steps. The described workflow should be explicit about these steps, and care should be taken to ensure that TRO snapshots are made at each step of more complex workflows. For instance, if there are additional data acquisition steps or software that is not scripted:

1. Obtain user code (TRO Arrangement 0)
2. Provision user project with restricted-access data (TRO Arrangement 1)
3. Run user code, part 1 (TRO Arrangement 2)
4. Manually run QGIS code to generate map (TRO Arrangement 3)
5. Run user code, part 2 (TRO Arrangement 4)
6. Apply disclosure avoidance vetting, modifying certain files (TRO Arrangement 5)


:::{admonition} Example: Running the example workflow
:class: note

```bash
cd $PROJBASE/sample-trace-workflow
docker build -t trace-example/sample-trace-workflow .
bash run_locally.sh latest trace-example
cd $PROJBASE
```

Record the changes made by the user code:

```bash
tro-utils --declaration $TROFILE arrangement add sample-trace-workflow \
    -m "After executing workflow" -i .git
```

Verify that the TRO contains two arrangements:

```bash
tro-utils --declaration $TROFILE arrangement list
```

with output

```bash
Arrangement(id=arrangement/0): Before executing workflow
Arrangement(id=arrangement/1): After executing workflow
```

:::

## Finalizing TRO

### Add details about the workflow execution

Once the workflow is completed, the host institution might want to augment the workflow information in the TRO with additional information. These details might be obtained from system logs or task tracking systems. These assertions should be added to the TRO before it is signed.

:::{admonition} Example: Adding details about the workflow execution
:class: note

In the example and using the `tro-utils`, we will record the following information, which may not have been visible in any process logs, or may have been captured from systems logs that handle various automated processing workflows:

```bash
tro-utils --declaration $TROFILE performance add \
  -m "My magic workflow" \
  -s 2025-01-15T09:22:01 \
  -e 2024-01-15T10:00:11 \
  -c trov:InternetIsolation \
  -c trov:InternetAccessRecording \
  -a arrangement/0 \
  -M arrangement/1
```

Note that `InternetIsolation` and `InternetAccessRecording` are capabilities that were defined in the TRS description, but which cannot be verified from any user code. They are assertions. For more information, see the [`tro-utils` documentation](https://pypi.org/project/tro-utils/).


:::

### Timestamp and sign the TRO

To wrap up, the TRO is signed. This ensures that no further modifications can be made to the TRO. The signature is created using the private key and stored in a separate file.

:::{admonition} Example: Signing the TRO
:class: note

```bash
tro-utils --declaration $TROFILE sign
```

(Optional) Verify the TRO:

```bash
tro-utils --declaration $TROFILE verify
```

with output

```bash
Using configuration from /usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf
Warning: certificate from '/tmp/tmp2607sx0l' with subject '/O=Free TSA/OU=TSA/description=This certificate digitally signs documents and time stamp requests made using the freetsa.org online services/CN=www.freetsa.org/emailAddress=busilezas@gmail.com/L=Wuerzburg/C=DE/ST=Bayern' is not a CA cert
Verification: OK
```

::: 

You should now have a TRO along with its signature and a time-stamp file (TSR).


:::{admonition} Example: TRO generated files
:class: note

In the example,  `sample_tro-(DATE-TIME).jsonld`,  `sample_tro.sig` and TSR in `sample_tro.tsr`. 

```bash
ls -1 $PROJBASE
```

```bash
sample-trace-workflow/
sample_tro-2025-04-25-09-20-26.jsonld
sample_tro-2025-04-25-09-20-26.sig
sample_tro-2025-04-25-09-20-26.tsr

```
:::


## Publishing the TRO and TRS

:::{margin} **Where is the content of the output produced?**
We need to complement the example to provide an example provision of the complete output. ZIP file? Bagit?
:::

Now we can proceed to publish the TRO.
The organization must provide a landing page where TROs can be indexed, possibly accessed, and TRS capabilities can be viewed.

- TROs themselves can reside on the organization's web server, or a trusted repository (e.g., [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org), Dataverse instances, etc.).
- TRS capabilities should be published on the organization's web server.
- Optionally, when not self-hosting TROs, the organization can provide a landing page that links to the TROs hosted on other repositories.
 
:::{margin} We could also provide an example with Zenodo (sandbox) for content/TRO
Use `zenodo_get` to create and publish.
:::

:::{admonition} Example: Publishing TROs and TRS locally
:class: note

We are going to use a simple Flask app with a template webpage capable of listing TROs and basic info about TRS. You can download it by running the following command:

```bash
cd $PROJBASE
git clone https://github.com/transparency-certified/trs-template
python3 -m venv ~/server-env
source ~/server-env/bin/activate
```

(All subsequent prompts should show `(server-env)`.)

```bash
cd $WEBBASE
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


**Publishing TROs**

Copy the TROs to the web server directory:

```bash
cp $PROJBASE/sample_tro-*  $WEBBASE/data/
```

Start the web server:

```bash
source ~/server-env/bin/activate
cd $WEBBASE
python3 app.py
```

Webserver should be available at `http://localhost:5000/`.
