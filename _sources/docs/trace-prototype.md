# TRACE Prototype

The TRACE Prototype has been developed as an end-to-end implementation to
facilitate requirements discussions. It consists of the following:

* https://server.trace-poc.xyz: Running instance of the TRACE prototype server
* [trace-prototype](https://github.com/transparency-certified/trace-prototype):
  contains source code for a proof-of-concept TRACE Server and associated
  commandline interface. 
* [sample-trace-workflow](https://github.com/transparency-certified/sample-trace-workflow/): Example
  workflow to demonstrate command-line integration including GitHub actions.

## server.trace-poc.xyz

This is a running instance of the
[trace-prototype](https://github.com/transparency-certified/trace-prototype) server
for use with the command line interface and to demonstrate GitHub actions
integration. It is a Docker-based implementation that uses repo2docker to build
a container image used to execute runs.

The website provides includes the following:
* TRACE Server ID: Unique identifier for this server (URI)
* TRACE Server Fingerprint: GPG public key for this server

## Submitting a Run

To submit a run to `server.trace-poc.xyz`, you must first intall the
`trace-prototype` client:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/transparency-certified/trace-prototype
```

Clone the
[sample-trace-workflow](https://github.com/transparency-certified/sample-trace-workflow)
repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/transparency-certified/sample-trace-workflow
cd sample-trace-workflow
```

Submit the run:
```
trace-poc submit --entrypoint "run.sh" --container-user rstudio --target-repo-dir "/home/rstudio" --trace-server https://server.trace-poc.xyz .
```

This will create a new entry on the server at https://server.trace-poc.xyz/.

## Inspecting the TRO

For each TRO generated by the server, it creates:
* TRS Signature (`.sig`): Digest of the contents of the TRO declaration signed using the TRS private key
* TRO Declaration (`.jsonld`): JSON-LD document containing the unique ID and public key of the TRS that produced the TRO, claims about the capabilities of the TRS, and a individual artifacts that are part of the TRO composition.
* TRO Composition (`.zip`): Comprises all of the digital artifacts (potentially unpersisted) that the TRO declaration describes.
* Trusted Timestamp (`.tsr`): A signed timestamp of the TRO declaration and TRS signature provided by a timestamp authority.

For more information, see the [Conceptual Model](conceptual-model) section.

To verify the TRS signature:

```
# Extract the public key from the TRO declaration:

cat <tro>.jsonld | jq -r '.["@graph"][]["trov:wasAssembledBy"]["trov:publicKey"]' > trs.gpg
gpg --import trs.gpg

gpg --verify <tro>.sig <tro>.jsonld
```

To view the trusted timestamp information:
```
openssl ts -reply -in <tro>.tsr -text
```

To verify the trusted timestamp:
```
wget https://freetsa.org/files/tsa.crt
wget https://freetsa.org/files/cacert.pem

openssl ts -verify -data file -in file.tsr -CAfile cacert.pem -untrusted tsa.crt 
```

## GitHub Action

The
[sample-trace-workflow](https://github.com/transparency-certified/sample-trace-workflow)
repository includes a [GitHub Action
workflow](https://github.com/transparency-certified/sample-trace-workflow/blob/main/.github/workflows/compute.yml)
that demonstrates using the TRACE prototype to create a TRO on push.
