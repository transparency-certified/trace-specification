# Our Approach 

By certifying the original execution of a computational workflow, consumers of
research can trust results without necessarily repeating the computations.
Instead of relying on researchers to
[self-certify](barriers-self-certification), TRACE requires that the operators
or owners of systems that researchers use adopt key practices to aid in the
production of transparent and trustworthy artifacts.

This includes:

* Providing information about the computing platforms themselves, including
  specific details about how computational transparency is supported.
* Packaging and signing resulting artifacts along with records of their
  execution using a standard format.

The first is motivated by the need to convey to consumers of research
information about the systems within which results were obtained, particularly
if these systems cannot be directly accessed or assessed. The second is
motivated by the need to provide a trustworthy record of computations to 
demonstrate how results were obtained.
