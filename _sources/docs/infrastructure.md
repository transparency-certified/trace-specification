# Overview

In addition to technical specifications, TRACE is developing a reusable software
toolkit and reference implementation for the creation, signing, and validation
of TROs. We will demonstrate how the toolkit can be used to TRACE-enable
existing systems through integration with the Whole Tale platform and
development of a proof-of-concept plugin for a SLURM cluster.

Infrastructure elements include:
* [TRACE Toolkit](trace-toolkit): A set of reusable programs and libraries
  implementing the TRACE specification.
* [Whole Tale Integration](wt-integration): Application of the trace-toolkit to
  TRACE-enable the Whole Tale platform.
* [SLURM Plugin](slurm-plugin): Application of the trace-toolkit to TRACE-enable
  a SLURM cluster.
