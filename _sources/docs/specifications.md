# Overview

At the core of the TRACE project is a conceptual model and technical
specification for formally describing TRACE Systems and TROs. TROs are an
extension of the research object concept. These specifications are designed to
systematically answer questions about TROs and the TRACE Systems that generate
them.

This section includes the following:

* [Transparency Questions](./questions): Questions that the TRACE specifications
  are intended to help answer.
* [Elements](./elements): TRACE elements
* [Conceptual Model](./conceptual-model): TRACE conceptual model
* [System Certificate Specification](system-certificate-spec): Technical
  specification for TRACE System certificates. Provide authoritative information
  about the system in which computations were executed.  
* Transparent Research Object Specification (TRO): Technical specification for TROs. An extension and
  clarification of the Research Object contept.
