# Building Trust in Computational Research

Reproducing an analysis can be hard or impossible (long compute times,
restricted compute resources, ephemerous or confidential data). 

The TRACE project proposes a novel solution: certify the successful *original*
execution of the (computational) workflow that produced the reported findings
*in situ*.
