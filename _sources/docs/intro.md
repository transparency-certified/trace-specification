# Building Trust in Computational Research

**Reproducing reported research findings can be difficult or impossible** when
the analysis that produced the findings relies on access-restricted data and/or
large-scale computational resources.

TRACE offers a framework for **certifying the original execution of the
computational workflow** that produced the reported findings *in situ*.
