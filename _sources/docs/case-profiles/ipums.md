# IPUMS

[IPUMS](https://ipums.org) is a service of the Minnesota Population Center that
provides integrated census and survey data from around the world. IPUMS
maintains nine different data products including IPUMS USA and IPUMS CPS, widely
used in social science research.  Researchers typically create custom extracts
using the IPUMS webiste or API (beta), but the extracts are subject to licenses
that restrict or prohibit redistribution. Additionally, the underlying data
products are subject to change over time, so there is no guarantee that a future
replicator will obtain the same extract using the original author's query.

* IPUMS USA: Full Count data may not be redistributed. Sample data may be
  published to meet journal requirements. 
* IPUMS CPS: Subsets of data may be published to meet journal requirements.
* IPUMS International: Redistribution is prohibited.
