# Questions for TRACE Systems

Adopting the role of someone responsible for verifying the transparency and
reproducibility of computational research artifacts, we consider the following
questions.

## Inputs

**1. What system was it run on?**

**2. Are all of the inputs provided?**

**3. If inputs are excluded, are they retained, identifiable, and accessible by
an authorized third party? How is it possible to determine that an excluded
input is the one that was actually used?**

**4. Can inputs be modified or removed during execution? If so, does the system
detect and record this? Is tinformation about modified/removed inputs
included?**

## Code

**5. Is the exact code used to execute steps of a computational workflow
included? If not, what is included?**

**6. Can code by modified or deleted during workflow execution? If so, does the
system detect and record this? Is information about modified/removed code
included in the TRO**
